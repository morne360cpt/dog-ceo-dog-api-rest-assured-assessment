# Dog Ceo Dog API - API REST ASSURED ASSESSMENT
The goal of this repository is to create **API automation test cases** for the Dog Ceo Dog API - API REST ASSURED ASSESSMENT.

The **src/test/java/com.dod.ceo.framework** folder is where the **DogCeoTestCases** java class file is found to execute all test cases.

## About this repository
This repository contains all the code samples that are shown in the videos of my REST Assured course that is part of Test Automation University.

## What do I need to run these samples?
A Java 8 JDK and Maven. That's it.
